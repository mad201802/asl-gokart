///   1. Call start() once to initialise / reset the animation.
///   2. Call tick() every frame (~20 ms).  It writes pixels directly
///      to the strip buffer and returns true while the animation is
///      still running.  When it returns false the animation is done.
///
/// The caller is responsible for calling strip->Show() after tick().

    /// @param height        Matrix height (rows).
    /// @param pixel_index   Mapping function: (col, row) → strip index.
    /// @param brightness    Global brightness multiplier (0–255).
    /// @return true while the animation is still playing, false when done.
